**Hey there!**

I'm creating open source software since 2018. Since then, these projects came
to life:
- [Gotify - self-hosted push notifications](https://gotify.net)
- [Screego - screen sharing for developers](https://screego.net)
- [Traggo - self-hosted time tracking](https://traggo.net)
- [Goverter - Go converter code generator](https://goverter.jmattheis.de)
